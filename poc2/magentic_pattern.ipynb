    "The **Magentic Pattern** demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Tool Integration**: Agents can discover and use tools based on task requirements\n",
    "2. **Function Calling**: Seamless integration of custom functions into agent capabilities\n",
    "3. **Flexible Architecture**: Different agents can have different tool sets for specialization\n",
    "4. **Context-Aware Selection**: Agents intelligently choose appropriate tools for each task\n",
    "5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities to existing agents\n",

    "- **Modularity**: Tools can be developed and maintained separately\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Same tools can be used across multiple agents\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easy to add new capabilities without modifying existing agents\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Agents can be configured with specific tool sets for their domain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "- Data processing pipelines\n",
    "- Multi-step calculations\n",
