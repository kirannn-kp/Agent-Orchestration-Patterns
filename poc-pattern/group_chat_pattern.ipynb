    "# Group Chat Orchestration Pattern with Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Group Chat Orchestration pattern using Microsoft Semantic Kernel in Python. Group chat orchestration involves multiple agents collaborating simultaneously on a shared task, leveraging Azure OpenAI services for intelligent responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Collaborative Execution**: Agents work together in real-time to address a shared task.\n",
    "- **Task Specialization**: Each agent contributes based on its expertise.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Interaction**: Agents can respond to each other's outputs, creating a dynamic and interactive workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "**Scientific Discussion**: Multiple agents (PhysicsExpert, ChemistryExpert, and BiologyExpert) collaborate to answer the question \"What is the impact of temperature on living organisms?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook utilizes `GroupChatOrchestration` and Semantic Kernel's agent orchestration framework to manage and execute tasks collaboratively, showcasing the power and flexibility of Semantic Kernel."
