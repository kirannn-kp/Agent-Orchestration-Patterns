    "# Sequential Orchestration Pattern with Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Sequential Orchestration pattern using Microsoft Semantic Kernel in Python. Sequential orchestration involves executing tasks in a predefined order, where the output of one step is used as input for the next step. This approach is ideal for workflows that require strict dependencies between steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Tasks are executed sequentially, ensuring proper order and dependencies.\n",
    "- **Task Specialization**: Each step is designed to perform a specific function or skill.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Mechanisms are implemented to manage errors at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "1. **Recipe Creation**: Extract ingredients, create step-by-step instructions, and review the recipe for clarity and completeness.\n",
    "2. **Document Processing**: Summarize a document, translate it, and ensure the translation is accurate and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook utilizes `SequentialPlanner` and Semantic Kernel's agent orchestration framework to manage and execute tasks sequentially, showcasing the power and flexibility of Semantic Kernel."
