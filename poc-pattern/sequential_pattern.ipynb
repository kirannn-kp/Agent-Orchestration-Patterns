    "# Sequential Orchestration Pattern with Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Sequential Orchestration pattern using Microsoft Semantic Kernel in Python. Sequential orchestration involves executing tasks in a predefined order, where the output of one step is used as input for the next step. This approach is ideal for workflows that require strict dependencies between steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Tasks are executed sequentially, ensuring proper order and dependencies.\n",
    "- **Task Specialization**: Each step is designed to perform a specific function or skill.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Mechanisms are implemented to manage errors at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "1. **Recipe Creation**: Extract ingredients, create step-by-step instructions, and review the recipe for clarity and completeness.\n",
    "2. **Document Processing**: Summarize a document, translate it, and ensure the translation is accurate and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook utilizes `SequentialPlanner` and Semantic Kernel's agent orchestration framework to manage and execute tasks sequentially, showcasing the power and flexibility of Semantic Kernel."

      "IngredientExtractorAgent: ### Review of the Chicken Stir-Fry Recipe Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "The instructions provided for the chicken stir-fry are clear, concise, and logical, with a user-friendly flow. Here is my detailed analysis, along with a few improvement suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. **Clarity**: \n",
      "   - The steps are straightforward and logically sequenced, ensuring even novice cooks can follow easily.\n",
      "   - Key actions like marinating the chicken and prepping vegetables are explained thoroughly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Completeness**:\n",
      "   - All ingredients are utilized, and their quantities are explicitly stated in both the list and steps.\n",
      "   - Cooking times are mentioned for each step, which helps to avoid overcooking or undercooking ingredients.\n",
      "   - Garnishing and serving suggestions are included to make the dish presentation-ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Efficiency**:\n",
      "   - The recipe minimizes the need for additional dishes by reusing the same pan for cooking chicken and vegetables.\n",
      "   - It suggests preparing the sauce while the chicken is marinating, saving time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Tips for Success**:\n",
      "   - Including details like coating the chicken in cornstarch for tender texture and ensuring vegetables are cut evenly is thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggested Improvements:\n",
      "1. **Specificity for Better Results**:\n",
      "   - **Chicken Cooking Time**: Instead of a broad range (\"5-7 minutes\"), clarify that cooking time might vary slightly depending on the thickness of the strips. A cue like “until no longer pink inside” ensures visual guidance.\n",
      "   - **Vegetable Doneness**: Some beginners might not understand \"tender-crisp.\" Consider adding a description like \"the vegetables should be slightly softened but still have a bit of crunch when bitten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sauce Adjustments**:\n",
      "   - Allow flexibility in the sweetness or saltiness based on taste preferences. For example, suggest tasting the sauce before adding it to the stir-fry and adjusting ingredients like soy sauce or honey.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Optional Enhancements**:\n",
      "   - Recommend additional flavors like a squeeze of fresh lime juice or a pinch of red chili flakes for a tangy or spicy kick.\n",
      "   - Suggest variations for dietary needs, such as using tamari or coconut aminos for a gluten-free version.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Serving Tip**:\n",
      "   - Suggest pairing with jasmine rice for a fragrant option or brown rice for a healthier choice. Including a note about garnishing with fresh lime wedges adds a nice visual and flavor touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Step 7 Clarification**:\n",
      "   - Instead of using \"dish or directly onto plates,\" perhaps suggest \"a serving platter or individual bowls\" for a polished presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Revised Steps Incorporating Suggestions:\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Cook the Chicken (Revised)\n",
      "- Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.\n",
      "- Add the marinated chicken strips and stir-fry for 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken is golden brown and fully cooked (internal temperature of 75°C / 165°F, or until no longer pink inside).\n",
      "- Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside on a plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 5: Stir-Fry the Vegetables (Revised)\n",
      "- In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.\n",
      "- Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for about 30 seconds or until fragrant but not browned.\n",
      "- Add the chopped vegetables and stir-fry for 5-7 minutes, or until slightly softened but still crisp when bitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 6: Combine Chicken and Vegetables (Revised)\n",
      "- Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the vegetables.\n",
      "- Give the sauce a final stir, then pour it evenly over the stir-fry. Stir everything thoroughly to coat the chicken and vegetables in sauce.\n",
      "- Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to bubble and thicken slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Thoughts:\n",
      "This recipe is well-designed and has a solid structure. Incorporating a few sensory cues and customization tips will make it even more accessible for varying skill levels. Overall, a satisfying, approachable option for a quick, balanced meal. Rating: **9/10**!\n",
