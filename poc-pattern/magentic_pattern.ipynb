    "# Magentic Orchestration Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Magentic orchestration pattern using Semantic Kernel and Azure OpenAI. The Magentic pattern is designed for complex, open-ended tasks that require dynamic collaboration between specialized agents, coordinated by a dedicated manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **Flexible coordination**: A Magentic manager coordinates specialized agents\n",
    "- **Dynamic workflow**: Adapts workflow in real-time based on task progress\n",
    "- **Complex problem solving**: Breaks down complex problems into subtasks\n",
    "- **Iterative refinement**: Multiple rounds of reasoning, research, and computation"
